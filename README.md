# Flashcardsish
Flashcardsish is a lightweight flashcards app where you can import sets, star cards, and more. It supports years, basic markdown, and a couple of other things.

It's fully open source (you're on the GitHub page) and free to use.

Owen Whelan did the whole vibe coding process for this in Google AI Studio. I don't know how to code, but modern flashcard apps are too bulky so this is how I solved that.

You can absolutely download and clone this for your own use, including publishing your own versions. I just ask you don't monetize it and you credit me (if it makes sense to).
