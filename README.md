# Flashcardsish

Flashcardsish is a lightweight flashcards app where you can import sets, star cards, and more. It supports years, basic markdown, and a couple of other things.

It's fully open source (you're on the GitHub page) and free to use.

# Credits

Owen Whelan did the whole vibe coding process for this. I started by using Google AI Studio but then shifted to Google Antigravity.

You can absolutely download and clone this for your own use, including publishing your own versions and downloading it for local use (something I actually recommend!). I just ask you don't monetize it and you credit me (if it makes sense to).
